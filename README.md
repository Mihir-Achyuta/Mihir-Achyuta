<summary>How I got started</summary>
<br/>
2019: I started Junior year of high school with <a href="https://github.com/LearningRepos/AP-Computer-Science-A-Work">AP Computer Science A</a> that covered basic Object Oriented Programming and Data Structures(like strings, arrays, arraylists) but I started taking programming seriously 2nd semester in 2020.
<br/>
<br/>
2020: Web development first piqued my interest for a while when seeing a lot of websites that looked good. I wanted to do that also so I decided to use <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/">Angela Yu's</a> Udemy course to learn HTML/CSS/JavaScript on the frontend and Node/MongoDB on the backend. After making a non tutorial project (A long since abandoned meme generator turnt into FontBlurbs), I decided to learn a <a href="https://github.com/LearningRepos/mySqlLearning">Relational Database(MySQL)</a> and gain a high level overview of <a href="https://github.com/LearningRepos/dataStructuresAndAlgoLearning">Data Structures</a> over the summer both courses by Colt Steele. Along with learning those independent from each other, I decided to dive into <a href="https://github.com/LearningRepos/reactLearning">React.js</a> in another Udemy Course and learnt how to connect a React Frontend With a Node Backend(the start of my project PaletteBuds).

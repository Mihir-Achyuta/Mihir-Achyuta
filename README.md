<summary>How I got started and my path:</summary>
<br/>
2019: I started Junior year of high school with <a href="https://github.com/LearningRepos/AP-Computer-Science-A-Work">AP Computer Science A</a> that covered basic Object Oriented Programming and Data Structures(like strings, arrays, arraylists) but I started taking programming seriously 2nd semester in 2020.
<br/>
<br/>
2020: Web development first piqued my interest for a while when seeing a lot of websites that looked good. I wanted to do that also so I decided to use <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/">Angela Yu's</a> Udemy course to learn HTML/CSS/JavaScript on the frontend and Node/MongoDB on the backend. After making a non tutorial project (A long since abandoned meme generator turnt into FontBlurbs), I decided to learn a <a href="https://github.com/LearningRepos/mySqlLearning">Relational Database(MySQL)</a> and gain a high level overview of <a href="https://github.com/LearningRepos/dataStructuresAndAlgoLearning">Data Structures</a> over the summer both courses by Colt Steele. Along with learning those independent from each other, I decided to dive into <a href="https://github.com/LearningRepos/reactLearning">React.js</a> in another Udemy Course and learnt how to connect a React Frontend With a Node Backend(the start of my project PaletteBuds). On the side I decided to dab into <a href="https://github.com/LearningRepos/mobileDevLearning">Flutter</a> since I wanted to learn how a mobile app was created. However, I switched to React Native since I wanted to fully concentrate on Fullstack JavaScript for now.
<br/>
<br/>
2021(ongoing): This was the year in which I would apply my skills namely in hackathons. I won 1st Place and Most Innovative at <a href="https://evprogrammingclub.github.io/EVPCHacks/">EVPC Hacks 2021</a> and Best Beginner Hack at <a href="https://dvhacks.tech">DV Hacks</a>. A startup reached out to me from placing in DV Hacks and thats how I got my first software engineering internship at Hardly working on React, Node, and AWS. In my hackathons I made use of React and Firebase since using a Backend As A Service(BAAS) allowed me to concentrate on making the Minimum Viable Project look good. And this was the year in which I would choose to study Computer Science at <a href="https://www.cs.wisc.edu/">UW-Madison</a> Starting Fall 2021.
